You would have to install node.js first to get node modules in these files(as the quantity of those files is numerous I did'nt uploaded it on the repo)
  Go to the main folder you have kept these files in and open powershell(type powershell in the path window above in your file explorer) and type npm install node
  After installation insure node modules file is located in 'myapp' folder
  Install express.js as well
